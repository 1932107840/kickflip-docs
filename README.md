Documentation for the [Kickflip Live Video SDK](http://kickflip.io) (Android, iOS, web).

## [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md)

These short tutorials show how to use the Kickflip SDKs. Includes code examples for iOS and Android platforms.

* [Getting started](tutorials/getting_started.md)

    A short overview of the Kickflip service, including how to set up your first Kickflip application.

* [How to add live video broadcasting to your apps](tutorials/live_video.md)

   Once you've gotten your application set up, you'll want to start broadcasting live video. This tutorial will guide
   you through the complete lifecycle of a stream, from setting up the stream to playing it back across platforms.

* [Creating your own streaming video service](tutorials/cloning_livestream.md)

    With the Kickflip SDK, you have everything you need to build a complete streaming video service, such as LiveStream, Bambuser or uStream, complete with user
    accounts and authentication, profiles, searching, tagging, and geo-location. This guide will give you a
    thorough tour of all of these Kickflip features by helping you build a complete video streaming service.
