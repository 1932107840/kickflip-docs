# Getting Started With Kickflip

This short guide will help you set up your first live video broadcasting application with Kickflip.

## Signing up for Kickflip

You'll first need to [sign up for Kickflip.io](https://kickflip.io/accounts/signup/). You can sign up with your email address, or with your Github account. 

It's absolutely free to get started! You won't even need to enter any credit card information until your app is ready to be shipped to your users.

## Registering your first application

Once you've signed up, you'll need to make your first "Application." This application will give you a set of credentials that you'll use to talk with the API, and an interface which will you allow to see all of your stream and user activity. 

To create your first application, click on the 'New Application' button.

Enter in the name of your app and press Submit. Alright! You've registered your first application. On your dashboard, you'll see your Application's information, including the Client ID and Client SDK credentials that you'll need to use with the SDKs. You can also click on the Application to see a detailed list of your streams, your users, and your usage statistics.

You can create as many applications as you like, even on the free plan.


## Adding the SDKs to your development environments

Now that you've registered your application, you'll want to set up your mobile application development environments to use the Kickflip SDK.
